# 🤖 AI-Assisted Development Case Study: AI Curation Engine

## 📋 **Project Overview**

This document provides a detailed case study of developing a complex AI system using **Cursor AI** and **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**. It demonstrates the potential and limitations of AI-assisted software development for production-ready systems.

## 🎯 **Development Timeline and Prompt Evolution**

### **Day 1: Initial System Architecture**

**User's Opening Request:**
> "Can you add extreme left wing and right wing propaganda samples?"

**System Response:** Added diverse political content samples and discovered the need for a more robust architecture.

**Key Architectural Prompt:**
> "Is relying solely on LLMs a good option for an independent Curation Engine?"

**AI Response:** Led to the design of a pluggable, multi-strategy architecture rather than LLM-only approach.

### **Day 2-3: Multi-Strategy Implementation**

**Technical Deep-Dive Prompts:**
```
"Create a multi-layer curation strategy with:
- Fast rule-based filters (< 100ms)
- Specialized AI models for toxicity/NSFW
- LLM analysis for complex edge cases"

"Make the curation engine strategy selection visible and interactive 
in the demo UI for real-time testing"
```

**Result:** Implementation of three distinct strategies (LLM-Only, Multi-Layer, Hybrid) with runtime switching capability.

### **Day 4-5: Production Readiness**

**Infrastructure and Deployment Prompts:**
```
"Create scripts for building and deploying locally and view the status of services"

"Create deployment scripts and related docs to deploy to AWS, Azure and OCI using terraform"
```

**Result:** Comprehensive multi-cloud infrastructure with Terraform modules, deployment automation, and health monitoring.

### **Day 6-7: Quality Assurance and Testing**

**Validation and Error Handling Prompts:**
```
"Remove BAML AI Integration fallback if it is still present"

"Don't ever fallback to hard-coded values.. just indicate the issue"

"Check all other field names are matching"
```

**Result:** Elimination of all mock/fallback code and implementation of real-only BAML integration with proper error handling.

### **Day 8: Academic Documentation**

**Technical Writing Prompts:**
```
"Write a technical paper on this with focus on BAML architecture"

"Make sure not to make any false claims/exaggerations.. 
it should be accurate and complete and pass peer reviews"

"How did you get all the stats listed in the paper?"
```

**Result:** Comprehensive technical paper with transparent methodology and academic integrity.

## 🔄 **Iterative Prompt Engineering Patterns**

### **Effective Prompt Patterns**

#### **1. Progressive Complexity Building**
```
Initial: "Add political content samples"
→ Follow-up: "Make it cover the entire political spectrum"
→ Refinement: "Ensure age-appropriate filtering works across political content"
→ Integration: "Test all strategies with political content across age groups"
```

#### **2. Quality-Driven Iteration**
```
Implementation: "Create BAML integration"
→ Validation: "Test with real content samples"
→ Error Handling: "Remove all fallback/mock data"
→ Production: "Add comprehensive error logging"
```

#### **3. Academic Rigor Enforcement**
```
Initial: "Write a technical paper"
→ Methodology: "Include source of all statistics"
→ Integrity: "Check that all references were actually studied"
→ Transparency: "Add threats to validity section"
```

### **Less Effective Prompt Patterns**

#### **1. Overly Broad Requests**
```
❌ "Make this production ready"
✅ "Add health checks, error handling, and deployment scripts"
```

#### **2. Assumption of Context**
```
❌ "Fix the performance issues"
✅ "The safety score shows NaN% - debug the API response structure"
```

#### **3. Academic Shortcuts**
```
❌ "Add relevant references"
✅ "Only include references to tools actually used in implementation"
```
