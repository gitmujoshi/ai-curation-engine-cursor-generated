## üîÑ Switching Models in Your App

Your curation engine uses **BAML** for LLM abstraction, making it easy to switch models:

### Update Ollama Model

```python
# In your BAML configuration
# Current (from BAML_Integration_Real.py):

# To switch to DeepSeek:
model_name = "deepseek-r1"

# To switch to Mistral:
model_name = "mistral"

# To switch to Phi-3:
model_name = "phi3"
```

### Environment Variable

```bash
# Set in your environment
export OLLAMA_MODEL="deepseek-r1"

# Or in docker-compose.yml
environment:
  - OLLAMA_MODEL=deepseek-r1
```

### Test Different Models

```bash
# Test Llama 3.2
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "llama3.2",
  "prompt": "Is this content safe for children?"
}'

# Test Mistral
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "mistral",
  "prompt": "Is this content safe for children?"
}'

# Test DeepSeek
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "deepseek-r1",
  "prompt": "Is this content safe for children?"
}'
```
